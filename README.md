Rebuilding Discord, using flash and discord.py-self


# Usage
This can be used to run in a github codespace if your organization is restricting access to Discord. This is simply just a crappy remake that allows you to send and view messages.

**How to use**

Step 1. Open a Github Codespace on main and install python and python debugger

Step 2. rename example.env to just .env and replace the discord token with your actual discord token. Note: the flask secret key can be what it is now, but i recommend changing it

Step 3. open up the python file and run it, make sure to open up port 5000 in the ports tab and make the visibilty private so no one can steal your token

Step 4. Wait until the python console prints out all your servers, then you can open the website on the port and enjoy
